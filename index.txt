Lecture 2. 
        -> Anatomy of HTML Tag
        -> start tag and ending tag depends on html elements
        -> some of the html elements does not have any content like <br>
        -> <br> known as self closing tag
        -> <hr> - horizontal line
        -> to change the by default values of line we need attributes
        -> <hr size="3"> so it creates a horizontal line of 3px (by default 1px) - size="3" is html attribute.
