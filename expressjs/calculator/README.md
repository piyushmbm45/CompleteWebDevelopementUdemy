## Calculator

#### adding two numbers

- we can send file by using get request
- use network section in inspect to see what data person entering or many more thing


- to manipulate data from browser to backend we need data in backend from browser
    - install body-parser

- but if you have express 4.16 or later then you dont need body parser.  
- res.send
    - send the string not the number only
        - see the calculator app.post -- if you send only result then it will give you error
